# Recommendation-System
Building a Movie Recommendation Model

This project involves developing a movie recommendation system using user ratings and the SVD algorithm in Python that suggests movies based on user preferences and behavior. The system leverages content-based filtering techniques to personalize recommendations. Using libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, the model is trained on movie ratings datasets (e.g., MovieLens) to understand user interests and item similarities. The final output provides tailored suggestions, enhancing user experience in discovering new content. The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity metrics, and model evaluation.
